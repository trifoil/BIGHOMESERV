By the time I got my first server up and running, I started computing school, and the school firewall blocks wireguard (here, wg-easy).

The method used by Nerd on the Street is using tls tunnelling to hide the vpn.

Here are the steps I had to do to set it up :

1) Install Fedora 

Install Fedora Server in a VM on your Truenas machine.

I enable the root account over cockpit by going in 

```
nano /etc/cockpit/disallowed-users
```

and commenting the line written "root".

Then connect through cockpit to your server.

2) Wireguard install

   First, install wireguard

   ```
   dnf install wireguard-tools -y
   ```

3) Enable IPv4 forwarding

   ```
   nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
   ```

   Add the following line

   ```
   net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```
   After saving, apply the configuration with :

   ```
   sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf
   ```

   It should look like this :
