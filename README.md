By the time I got my first server up and running, I started computing school, and the school firewall blocks wireguard (here, wg-easy).

The method used by Nerd on the Street is using tls tunnelling to hide the vpn.

Here are the steps I had to do to set it up :

1) Install Debian 

Install Debian with docker on your Truenas machine. It's quite simple because the name of the image you pull is debian.

Then connect through ssh to your container.

2) Wireguard install

First, install wireguard

```
apt install wireguard
```
Then we can look at the Kernel version, but the one we pulled is supposedly generig and hence you don't need another one.

```
uname -r
```
3) Enable IPv4 forwarding

```

```
