## Installation of TrueNAS Scale <a name="installation"></a>

This tutorial describes the web interface configuration

## Disk Management and RAID Configuration <a name="disk-management"></a>

TrueNAS uses ZFS filesystem, so even if the concepts are still similar to RAID, it bears the name of RAID-Z.

### Disk Management <a name="disk-management"></a>



### RAID-Z Configuration <a name="raid-z"></a>

* RAID-Z1 (Single Parity, similar to RAID 5):

    * One drive is used for parity, and the rest are for data.
    * Can tolerate the failure of a single drive.

* RAID-Z2 (Double Parity, similar to RAID 6):

    * Two drives are used for parity, and the rest are for data.
    * Can tolerate the failure of two drives.

* RAID-Z3 (Triple Parity):

    * Three drives are used for parity, and the rest are for data.
    * Can tolerate the failure of three drives.

* Mirror Vdev (Similar to RAID 1):

    * Pairs of drives are used in a mirror configuration.
    * Provides excellent redundancy but reduces the usable space.

* Striped Vdev (Similar to RAID 0):

    * Drives are combined into a single striped set. 
    * Provides increased storage capacity and performance but no redundancy.

* Mixed Vdevs (Combination of the above):

    * You can mix and match different types of vdevs in a pool to achieve your desired balance of performance and redundancy.

### RAID-Z Configuration <a name="raid-configuration"></a>

My personal configuration is 4 HDDs of 1Tb each.

I will use RAID-Z1 to have a good balance between redundancy and speed :

* 4 x 1Tb HDDs should give me about 3Tb of storage.
* Up to one disk can fail at a time.
